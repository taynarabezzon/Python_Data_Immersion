## 🐍Python Data Immersion - Alura (Aug 2025)

## About this Project
This repository contains the results of an intensive 4-day Data Analysis program promoted by Alura. The goal was to develop end-to-end analytical skills, from raw data manipulation to the creation of interactive visualization tools.

### Core Technical Skills Developed
**Python for Data Science:** Basic syntax applied to analytical problem-solving.
**Data Wrangling with Pandas:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing complex datasets
**Data Merging & Exploration:** Combining multiple data sources to uncover hidden business insights.
**Dashboard Engineering with Streamlit:** Building a web-based interactive interface for data storytelling.
**Reproducible Research:** Using Jupyter Notebooks to document analysis, assumptions, and findings.

### Project Goals
The materials gathered here serve as a practical foundation for my transition into Data Science. They demonstrate my ability to:

1. Translate business questions into Python code.
2. Clean and structure data for reliable analysis.
3. Communicate results through clear, interactive visuals.

### Certification
A certificate of participation was issued by Alura, validating the completion of all technical modules.
